# Deployment Groups

You specify deployment groups with the deploymentGroups property. It is an object whose keys are paths to deployment groups, and values contain configuration for the corresponding deployment group.

#### Example

Here's an example of deployment configuration with five deployment groups:

```yaml title="deployment/targets.yml"
deploymentGroups:
  all/shared: {}
  all/application/dev: {}
  all/application/prod: {}
```

The deployment groups in this example form the following hierarchy:

```shell
all
├─ shared
└─ application
   ├─ dev
   └─ prod
```

There is one root-level deployment group named all, and under it, there are deployment groups all/shared and all/application. The all/application deployment group has two children: all/application/dev and all/application/prod.
