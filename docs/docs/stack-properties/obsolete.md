# Obsolete

You can exclude stacks from configuration by marking them as obsolete with the `obsolete` property. Obsolete stacks can be removed with [prune stacks command](../command-line-usage/prune-stacks.md).
Obsolete stacks can't have dependents that are not obsolete themselves.

#### Examples

Setting the obsolete property:

```yaml
obsolete: true
```

## Usage in configuration

`obsolete` property can be defined in:

- stack group configuration files
- blueprint configuration files
- stack configuration files

### Stack group config file

When `obsolete` property is defined in a stack group configuration file:

- its value completely overrides the value inherited from the parent stack group
- its value is inherited by stack groups and stacks that belong under the stack group

### Blueprint config file

When `obsolete` property is defined in a blueprint configuration file:

- its value completely overrides the value inherited from the parent stack group
- its value is inherited by stacks that extend the blueprint

### Stack config file

When `obsolete` property is defined in a stack configuration file:

- if the stack extends a blueprint, its value completely overrides the value inherited from the blueprint
- otherwise, its value completely overrides the value inherited from the parent stack group

## Requirements

The `obsolete` property must satisfy these requirements:

- Must be a boolean
