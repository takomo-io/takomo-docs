# Regions

You specify the regions where to deploy a stack using the `regions` property. You can give a single region or a list of regions. Each stack must have at least one region.

#### Examples

Specifying a single region:

```yaml
regions: eu-west-1
```

Specifying multiple regions:

```yaml
regions:
  - eu-central-1
  - eu-north-1
  - us-east-1
```

## Usage in configuration

`regions` property can be defined in:

- stack group configuration files
- blueprint configuration files
- stack configuration files

### Stack group config file

When `regions` property is defined in a stack group configuration file:

- its value completely overrides the value inherited from the parent stack group
- its value is inherited by stack groups and stacks that belong under the stack group

### Blueprint config file

When `regions` property is defined in a blueprint configuration file:

- its value completely overrides the value inherited from the parent stack group
- its value is inherited by stacks that extend the blueprint

### Stack config file

When `regions` property is defined in a stack configuration file:

- if the stack extends a blueprint, its value completely overrides the value inherited from the blueprint
- otherwise, its value completely overrides the value inherited from the parent stack group

## Requirements

The `regions` property must satisfy these requirements:

- Must be a string or a list of strings
- Must be valid region

## Changing regions

You can't change the stack's region. If you change the region of an existing stack, Takomo will look for a corresponding stack from the new region. As Takomo does not keep track of the stacks it has deployed, it can't know that the stack still exists in the old region.

You can always add new regions for a stack.
