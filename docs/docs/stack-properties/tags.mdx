# Tags

You specify stack tags with the `tags` property. CloudFormation automatically adds the tags to each resource in the stack that supports tagging.

#### Examples

Setting tags:

```yaml
tags:
  foo: bar
  code: 123
  backups: true
```

## Usage in configuration

`tags` property can be defined in:

- stack group configuration files
- blueprint configuration files
- stack configuration files

### Stack group config file

When `data` property is defined in a stack group configuration file:

- its value is merged with the value inherited from the parent stack group
- its value is inherited by stack groups and stacks that belong under the stack group

### Blueprint config file

When `data` property is defined in a blueprint configuration file:

- its value is merged with the value inherited from the parent stack group
- its value is inherited by stacks that extend the blueprint

### Stack config file

When `data` property is defined in a stack configuration file:

- if the stack extends a blueprint, its value is merged with the value inherited from the blueprint
- otherwise, its value is merged with the value inherited from the parent stack group

## Configuration merging

Configuration merging happens when a stack group, blueprint or stack inherits `tags` property but also defines `tags` property of its own.

Tags are merged recursively.

## Requirements

The `tags` property must satisfy these requirements:

- Each tag key must be a string
- Each tag value must be a string, a number or a boolean
