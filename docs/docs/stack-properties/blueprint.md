# Blueprint

You can make a stack inherit configuration from a blueprint with `blueprint` property.

Blueprints are normal stack configuration but can't be deployed themselves. Instead, other stacks can inherit configuration from blueprints. Blueprints are located in blueprints directory. You can find more information about blueprints [here](../blueprints/introduction.md).

#### Examples

Setting the `blueprint` property:

```yaml
blueprint: application.yml
```

## Usage in configuration

`blueprint` property can be defined only in stack configuration files.

## Requirements

The `blueprint` property must satisfy these requirements:

- Must be a file path relative to blueprint directory in the project root
