# Ignore

You can exclude stacks and stack groups from the configuration with the `ignore` property.

#### Examples

Setting the ignore property:

```yaml
ignore: true
```

## Usage in configuration

`ignore` property can be defined in:

- stack group configuration files
- blueprint configuration files
- stack configuration files

### Stack group config file

When `ignore` property is defined in a stack group configuration file:

- its value completely overrides the value inherited from the parent stack group
- its value is inherited by stack groups and stacks that belong under the stack group
- if the value is set to **true**, stack groups and stacks that belong under the stack group can't set it back to **false**

### Blueprint config file

When `ignore` property is defined in a blueprint configuration file:

- its value is inherited by stacks that extend the blueprint

### Stack config file

When `ignore` property is defined in a stack configuration file:

- if the stack extends a blueprint, its value completely overrides the value inherited from the blueprint
- otherwise, its value is used as is

## Requirements

The `ignore` property must satisfy these requirements:

- Must be a boolean
