# Built-In Hooks

You can use hooks to execute actions at specific stages of stack deploy and undeploy operations. Takomo has two built-in hooks, and you can also implement your own.
In a stack configuration, you choose which type of hook to use by providing value to the type property. You also need to give a name for each hook. In addition to these two mandatory properties, each hook type may have its own set of additional properties.

Here are the built-in hooks:

- [Command hook](command-hook.md)
- [Checksum hook](checksum-hook.md)
